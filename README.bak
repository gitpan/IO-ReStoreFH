IO::ReStoreFH

Redirecting and restoring I/O streams is straightforward but a chore,
and can lead to strangely silent errors if you forget to restore
STDOUT or STDERR.

IO::ReStoreFH helps keep track of the present state of filehandles and
low-level file descriptors and restores them either explicitly or when
the IO::ReStoreFH object goes out of scope.
