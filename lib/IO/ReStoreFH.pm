# In Perl 5.10.1 a use or require of FileHandle or something in the

# by checking for the stash) and aliases it to IO::Handle.
#
#  This it mucks up method calls on filehandles if FileHandle isn't

=head1 NAME

IO::ReStoreFH - store/restore file handles


=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use IO::ReStoreFH;

	{
	   my $fhstore = IO::ReStoreFH->new( *STDOUT );

	   open( STDOUT, '>', 'file' );
	} # STDOUT will be restored when $fhstore is destroyed

	# or, one at-a-time
	{
	   my $fhstore = IO::ReStoreFH->new;
	   $store->store( *STDOUT );
	   $store->store( $myfh );

	   open( STDOUT, '>', 'file' );
	   open( $myfh, '>', 'another file' );
	} # STDOUT and $myfh will be restored when $fhstore is destroyed



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Redirecting and restoring I/O streams is straightforward but a chore,
and can lead to strangely silent errors if you forget to restore
STDOUT or STDERR.

B<IO::ReStoreFH> helps keep track of the present state of filehandles and
low-level file descriptors and restores them either explicitly or when
the B<IO::ReStoreFH> object goes out of scope.

It uses the standard Perl filehandle duplication methods (via B<open>)
for filehandles, and uses B<POSIX::dup> and B<POSIX::dup2> for file
descriptors.

File handles and descriptors are restored in the reverse order that
they are stored.

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item new

	my $fhstore = IO::ReStoreFH->new;
	my $fhstore = IO::ReStoreFH->new( $fh1, $fh2, $fd, ... );

Create a new object and an optional list of Perl filehandles or
integer file descriptors.

The passed handles and descriptors will be duplicated to be restored
when the object is destroyed or the B<restore> method is called.

=item store

	$fhstore->store( $fh );

	$fhstore->store( $fd );

The passed handles and descriptors will be duplicated to be restored
when the object is destroyed or the B<restore> method is called.

=item restore

   $fhstore->restore;

Restore the stored file handles and descriptors, in the reverse order
that they were stored.  This is automatically called when the object
is destroyed.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=for author to fill in:
	List every single error and warning message that the module can
	generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
	explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
	suggested remedies.

=over

=item C<< $fh is not an open filehandle >>

The passed filehandle failed a check to ensure that it was an open
filehandle.  Make sure it's a) a real filehandle; b) it's open.

=item C<< inexplicable error: unable to determine mode for $fh >>

B<IO::ReStoreFH> was unable to get the access mode for the passed file
handle.  Are you sure that it's really a filehandle object?

=item C<< error fdopening %s: %s >>

Perl B<open()> was unable to duplicate the passed filehandle for the
specified reason.

=item C<< error dup'ing file descriptor %s: %s >>

B<POSIX::dup()> was unable to duplicate the passed file descriptor for the
specified reason.

=item C<< $fh must be opened Perl filehandle or object or integer file descriptor >>

The passed C<$fh> argument wasn't recognized as a Perl filehandle or a
file descriptor.  Please try again.

=item C<< error restoring file descriptor %d: %s >>

Attempting to restore the file descriptor failed for the specified reason.

=item C<< error restoring file handle %s: %s >>

Attempting to restore the Perl file handle failed for the specified reason.

=back
