=head1 NAME

IO::ReStoreFH - store/restore file handles


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::ReStoreFH;

    {
       my $fhstore = IO::ReStoreFH->new( *STDOUT );

       open( STDOUT, '>', 'file' );
    } # STDOUT will be restored when $fhstore is destroyed

    # or, one at-a-time
    {
       my $fhstore = IO::ReStoreFH->new;
       $store->store( *STDOUT );
       $store->store( $myfh );

       open( STDOUT, '>', 'file' );
       open( $myfh, '>', 'another file' );
    } # STDOUT and $myfh will be restored when $fhstore is destroyed



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Redirecting and restoring I/O streams is straightforward but a chore,
and can lead to strangely silent errors if you forget to restore
STDOUT or STDERR.

B<IO::ReStoreFH> helps keep track of the present state of filehandles and
low-level file descriptors and restores them either explicitly or when
the B<IO::ReStoreFH> object goes out of scope.  It B<only> works with
filehandles for which B<fileno()> returns a defined value.

It uses the standard Perl filehandle duplication methods (via B<open>)
for filehandles, and uses B<POSIX::dup> and B<POSIX::dup2> for file
descriptors.

File handles and descriptors are restored in the reverse order that
they are stored.

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item new

    my $fhstore = IO::ReStoreFH->new;
    my $fhstore = IO::ReStoreFH->new( $fh1, [ $fh2, $mode ], $fd, ... );

Create a new object.  Optionally pass a list of Perl filehandles,
integer file descriptors, or filehandle - B<open()> file mode pairs.
The latter is typically only necessary if B<fcntl()> does not return
access mode flags for filehandles.

The passed handles and descriptors will be duplicated to be restored
when the object is destroyed or the B<restore> method is called.

=item store

    $fhstore->store( $fh );
    $fhstore->store( $fh, $mode );

    $fhstore->store( $fd );

The passed handles and descriptors will be duplicated to be restored
when the object is destroyed or the B<restore> method is called.
C<$mode> is optional; and only necessary if the platform's B<fcntl>
does not provide access mode flags.


=item restore

   $fhstore->restore;

Restore the stored file handles and descriptors, in the reverse order
that they were stored.  This is automatically called when the object
is destroyed.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=for author to fill in:
    List every single error and warning message that the module can
    generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
    explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
    suggested remedies.

=over

=item C<< $fh object does not have a fileno method >>

Objects passed to B<IO::ReStoreFH> must provide a fileno method.  They
really need to be file handles.

=item C<< $fh is not open >>

The passed file handle was not attached to a file descriptor.

=item C<< unable to determine mode for %s; please pass it as an argument >>

B<IO::ReStoreFH> was unable to get the access mode for the passed file handle
using B<fcntl> or a match against file descriptors 0, 1, or 2.  You
will need to explicitly provide the Perl access mode used to create
the file handle.

=item C<< error fdopening %s: %s >>

Perl B<open()> was unable to duplicate the passed filehandle for the
specified reason.

=item C<< error dup'ing file descriptor %s: %s >>

B<POSIX::dup()> was unable to duplicate the passed file descriptor for the
specified reason.

=item C<< $fh must be opened Perl filehandle or object or integer file descriptor >>

The passed C<fh> argument wasn't recognized as a Perl filehandle or a
file descriptor.  Please try again.

=item C<< error restoring file descriptor %d: %s >>

Attempting to restore the file descriptor failed for the specified reason.

=item C<< error restoring file handle %s: %s >>

Attempting to restore the Perl file handle failed for the specified reason.
